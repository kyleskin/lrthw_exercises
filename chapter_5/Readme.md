# Chapter 5: More Variables and Printing


## What you should see:
```
(113796139_chapter_5_master) Kyle Skinner
Kyle:chapter_5 $ ./ex5.rb
Let's talk about Zed A. Shaw
He's 74 inches tall.
He's 180 pounds heavy.
Actually that's not too heavy.
He's got Blue eyes and Brown hair.
His teeth are usually White depending on the coffee.
If I add 35, 74, and 180 I get 289.
```

## Study Drills:
### 1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.
> See my_ex5.rb

### 2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Ruby.
 > See my_ex5.rb
