# Chapter 8: Printing, Printing

## What you should see:
```
(113796151_chapter_8_master) Kyle Skinner
Kyle:chapter_8 $ ./ex8.rb
1 2 3 4
one two three four
true false true false
%{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth} %{first} %{second} %{third} %{fourth}
I had this thing. That you could type up right. But it didn't sing. So I said goodnight.
```


## Study Drills:
### 1. Do your checks, write down your mistakes, and try not to make the same mistakes on the next exercise.
Awesome sauce.

### Pivotal Tracker Question: Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?
I think that interpolation is easier to read quickly, but format strings make it easier to have multiple variables inserted.

I had to make sure I wasn't using double quotes unless necessary.  Also, I had to wrap a line because it was 13 characters too long.
