Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.

```

## Study Drills:
### 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
See ex7.rb

### 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
Done and done.

### 3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
Will do.

### 4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
Great advice.

### 5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
All right.

### Pivotal Tracker Question: Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own words in the Readme.md.
`puts` creates a line break at the end of the outputted string, meaning the next output will be on another line.  `print` does not create that line break.
