#Questions:
>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1. Go through each exercise.
2. Type in each sample *exactly*.
3. Make it run.

>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

I think I can sum up those three skills with one basic mantra: **Don't Be Lazy**.  Although we keep hearing that a good programmer is a lazy programmer, I think that learning a new language means not taking shortcuts and cheating yourself of practice.  It means putting in the work to actually type everything out, think about what I'm typing, and make sure that it works correctly.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

The point of the exercises to is train yourself to do a new thing.  You accomplish that by engaging your hands and brain.  Copying and pasting keeps you from being engaged.

>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Like with learning any new skill, learning Ruby will be difficult.  There will be things I don't know and that frustrate me, but if I continue to practice and I don't give up, I will be able to move through the mental blocks and come out the other side.
