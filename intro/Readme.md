#Questions:
>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

1. Reading & Writing
2. Attention to Detail
3. Spotting Differences

>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

1. It's important to be able to type everything out to get used to typing the odd characters that coding uses.
2. You must pay attention to everything you're being asked to type and reproduce to ensure that you have not missed any of the elements because that will make the program not run correctly.
3. As you're typing, you're bound to make a few mistakes.  Being able to spot the differences means it will be easier to identify where your mistakes are to be able to fix them.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

The point of the exercises to is train yourself to do a new thing.  You accomplish that by engaging your hands and brain.  Copying and pasting keeps you from being engaged.

>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Like with learning any new skill, learning Ruby will be difficult.  There will be things I don't know and that frustrate me, but if I continue to practice and I don't give up, I will be able to move through the mental blocks and come out the other side.
