# Chapter 10: What was that?

## What you should see:
```
(113796159_chapter_10_master) Kyle Skinner
Kyle:chapter_10 $ ./ex10.rb
	I'm tabbed in.
I'm split
on a line.
I'm \ a \ cat.

I'll do a list:
	* Cat food
	* Fishies
	* Catnip
	* Grass
```


## Study Drills:
### 1. Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.
Will do

### 2. Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """?
When I use the triple-single-quote, it no longer recognizes the escaped `\t`.

### 3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.
See ex10.rb
